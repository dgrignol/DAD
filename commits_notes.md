## Experiment code and documentation

### `experiment/MoveDot1_experiment_vX.m`
- Delay the `desiredFrameRate` assignment until stimulus FPS is loaded, then set
  `Conf.refrate` from `Dat.Cfg.fps` and mirror it into `desiredFrameRate`.
- Add a safety guard (for non-practice runs) that checks for existing output
  files (`*_SUBxx_RUNyy` and `*_firstBlock`, both with and without `.mat`) and
  aborts the run with a detailed error if any exist, preventing accidental
  overwrites.
- Precompute catch-phase durations in whole frames (fixation and occlusion
  phases) to avoid repeated floating-point comparisons and to keep frame
  boundaries consistent.
- Replace all catch-phase comparisons with the precomputed frame counts,
  including the "last frame" checks and occlusion boundary logic.
- Add a refresh-rate sanity check immediately after opening the Psychtoolbox
  window: compute the measured Hz from `GetFlipInterval` and warn if it differs
  from the expected rate by more than 1 Hz or 5%.
- Update the EyeLink file preamble text to the new project label
  ("Damiano Attention Dot Project").

### `experiment/lib/Config.m`
- Increase `frameFrequency` from 60 to 120 to reflect the higher display
  refresh rate expected by the experiment configuration.

### `experiment/trigger_codes.md`
- Rewrite the trial-onset mapping to make the block/condition logic explicit:
  blockCondition 1 uses 1-20 (condition 0) or 21-40 (condition 45), and
  blockCondition 2 uses 41-60 or 61-80.
- Clarify catch start/end semantics as "glitch" boundaries rather than generic
  start/end wording.
- Expand response trigger notes: 201 is expected; 202 is flagged as unexpected
  and is not in `TriggerValues`.
- Add notes about how `condition` maps to `directionVariance` and how
  `blockCondition` is sourced from `BlockOrder`.

### `experiment/TODO.md`
- Add a new "SAVING ISSUE" checklist with concrete failure modes and mitigation
  ideas (backup save, saving order, catch output indexing risks, teardown
  ordering, and partial save on ESC).
- Add a task to update scripts for the new data folder layout (notably
  `inspect_fif_report.py` for `data/subXX/MEG/subXX_runYY.fif`).
- Add tasks to build a trigger-fix script for subject 99 simulation issues and
  to improve trigger checking for replays (using 150/151 and summary stats).
- Mark two items in the "FROM DAVIDE" section as completed.

## Trigger analysis tooling

### `trigger_events.py` (new)
- Introduce `find_events_with_overlaps`, a helper that wraps
  `mne.find_events(..., output="step")` and adds non-zero-to-non-zero steps so
  overlapping triggers are not lost.
- Implement step merging, mask handling, and duplicate filtering to keep the
  output compatible with MNE event arrays while preserving overlaps.

### `inspect_fif_report.py`
- Switch event detection from `mne.find_events` to
  `find_events_with_overlaps`, enabling detection of overlapping trigger
  transitions.
- Update default FIF selection: when `--subject` is provided and `--fif` is the
  default, the script now targets
  `data/subXX/MEG/subXX_runYY.fif` (with `--run`).
- Expand expected-trigger loading to auto-discover block files via a glob
  pattern, track per-block ranges, and maintain block-order concatenation.
- Add overlap resolution logic that uses the expected sequence to decide which
  overlapping trigger to close or start, and advance the expected index
  accordingly.
- Add automatic CSV output routing: when using the default output path and
  `--subject` is set, write per-block outputs if expected block files exist;
  otherwise write a single per-run output.
- Add an HTML "Missing triggers" summary that counts and reports missing
  expected triggers (e.g., "101 -> X missing out of Y") beneath the table.

### `plot_trigger_chan.py` (new)
- Provide a CLI tool for interactive, scrollable visualization of the trigger
  channel with a slider and mouse-wheel scrolling.
- Support detached plotting (`--no-block`) by spawning a child Python process.
- Add `--plot-missing` to read a report HTML, infer missing-trigger midpoints,
  and overlay them in red on the plot.
- Allow selecting the time origin (`raw` vs `absolute`) and handle clipping of
  missing points to the data range.

## Reports

### `reports/dRSA_Att_test00_report.html` (new)
- New MNE report for the `dRSA_Att_test00` data with a "Triggers" section,
  including an embedded trigger-channel plot and a trigger table.
- Includes a "Check passed: all triggers allowed" status.
- Footer indicates creation on 2026-01-07 16:06:05 with MNE-Python 1.11.0.

### `reports/sub04_run01_report.html` (new)
- New MNE report for subject 04, run 01 with trigger-channel visualization and
  a trigger table that includes a `match` column against expected triggers.
- The table shows multiple 201 entries with match=0 and several 101 entries
  marked "MISSING".
- Includes a missing-trigger summary line (101 missing out of 20) and a
  "Check passed: all triggers allowed" status.
- Footer indicates creation on 2026-01-08 10:55:22 with MNE-Python 1.10.1.

### `reports/sub99_report.html`
- Update the report title to reference `sub99_run01.fif` instead of
  `raw_sub99.fif`.
- Trigger table now includes two match columns: `match` and `match debug1`,
  consistent with comparing against multiple actual-trigger sources.
- Footer timestamp updated to 2026-01-07 16:06:40 (MNE-Python 1.11.0).

## Python bytecode artifacts

### `__pycache__/inspect_fif_report.cpython-313.pyc`
### `__pycache__/trigger_events.cpython-313.pyc`
- Binary `.pyc` files generated by Python 3.13 when running the scripts above.
  These are compiled caches with no textual diff.
